Scraper created using puppeteer. The program scrapes prices from given computer products and saves them
in a file. With each new launch of the program, the differences in prices from previous measurements
are compared. Current excahnge rates are taken from external APIs.

The program is created for scientific purposes only. It not used anywhere.

Remember to use the scraping mechanism carefully. It can put a heavy load on some websites when
scraping is started too many times. Not every website allows you to scrape data.
